==== Version 1.0.1-001 (tag: not tagged yet) ====

Next bleeding edge version on the way to 1.0.2 for the rockit 
Common UI project. Changes summary:
* ScriptTag is now abstracted away from Volantis.  

==== Version 1.0.1 (tag: v1_0_1) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.1 of the rockit Common UI project 
(http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). This iteration focused mainly 
on the project structure, testbed structure and build scripts. 
All build targets should work.
