==== Version 1.0.9 (tag: core_v1_0_9) ====

ReportingUtilities JavaScript class: "to" method now always
sets the "xrw=xhr" request parameter. Some phones like the Nokia 
6120 do not allow request headers to be set
so mootools fails to set the 'X-Requested-With header' to 'XMLHttpRequest' (and
the browser itself doesn't set this). So we always set an additional request
parameter corresponding to the header. This allows server side code to detect AJAX requests.  

==== Version 1.0.8 (tag: core_v1_0_8) ====

Added new util subcomponent to serve up Yoanes' utils.js. Widened the list 
of devices that the core and logging MSCR files apply to (still not the 
"real" list - just for current adhoc testing).

==== Version 1.0.7 (tag: core_v1_0_7) ====

Added custom autoIncId JSP tag, implemented by the AutoIncIdTag class.

==== Version 1.0.6 (tag: core_v1_0_6) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.6 (and 1.0.5 since I skipped that tag) 
of the rockit Common UI project (http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). 
These iterations focused mainly on stabilising the framework.

==== Version 1.0.4 (tag: core_v1_0_4) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.4 of the rockit Common UI project 
(http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). This iteration focused mainly 
on adding logging support to the current framework, adding a template
component and fixing up various other, smaller issues.

==== Version 1.0.3 (tag: core_v1_0_3) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.3 of the rockit Common UI project 
(http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). This iteration focused mainly 
on testing the current framework by prototyping the networknav and
map components and (locally) integrating them into WPM.

==== Version 1.0.1-001 (tag: not tagged yet) ====

Next bleeding edge version on the way to 1.0.2 for the rockit 
Common UI project. Changes summary:
* ScriptTag is now abstracted away from Volantis.  

==== Version 1.0.1 (tag: core_v1_0_1) ====

Deliverable from iteration 1.0.1 of the rockit Common UI project 
(http://jira.sensis.com.au/browse/CUI). This iteration focused mainly 
on the project structure, testbed structure and build scripts. 
All build targets should work.
