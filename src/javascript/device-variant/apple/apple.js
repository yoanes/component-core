// TODO: empty placeholder JavaScript file. Current build scripts (based on the prototype) has flaws:
// 1. The build scripts will fail if the device-variant source directory does not exist. This in turn can easily
//    happen if the directory exists in CVS but it is empty, leading to the directory not being checked out 
//    under typical CVS -prune behaviour.
// 2. The current component strucure will not produce any bundles if there is no device variant source,
//    even if there is device invariant source.
